[Echoes Of Steel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580010/Echoes_Of_Steel/) is a high-fidelity third person shooter game, with over 70% positive reviews on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580010/Echoes_Of_Steel/). The player faces off against both melee and ranged AI, battling through challenging levels to progress.

Designed, developed and published by me, as a solo developer.

Taking this game from ideation to publishing, I've learned many valuable lessons from the whole process, and I documented the journey on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@iltenahmet/). 

One of the most rewarding moments was engineering the enemy AI to deliberately miss some shots â€” a practical application of my Linear Algebra class knowledge, which I detailed in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLnRGfe3s20&t=181s).

The game includes:
- A comprehensive combat system featuring animation-driven movement, melee, shooting, and reload mechanics, all integrated with the AI behavior.
- A Dynamic inventory system with seamless weapon swapping, discarding, and acquisition.
- Intelligent AI agents with autonomous decision making and navigation in a 3D environment.
- Nice ancient quotes. 
- The secret for a good life.

I've used Unreal Engine 5.1. The core gameplay logic is written in C++, with some parts extended in Blueprints. I've used Perforce for Version Control, and hosted the repository on a DigitalOcean droplet.

The creation of this game was only possible due to the work of many artists who put their work online (often for free), and developers who created resources for me to learn from.
