I've used Unreal Engine 5.1. The most of the core logic is in C++, with some parts extended in Blueprints. I've used Perforce for Version Control, and hosted the repository on a DigitalOcean droplet.

Although I've developed this game solo, it was only possible due to the work of many developers and artists who put their work online (often for free), or created resources for me to learn game development. 

Here's a list of resources I've used to create this game:
