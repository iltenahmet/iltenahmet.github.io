A web-based habit tracker that allows users to create accounts, set habit frequencies, earn XP and level up based on habit adherence. Habit colors also adapt to reflect adherence levels. 

You can check the [source code](https://github.com/iltenahmet/gamified-habit-tracker/) on my Github. And you can check the app [here](https://gamified-habit-tracker.vercel.app/). I've used:

- Javascript on the backend
- NextJS as frontend framework
- tailwind.css as css framework
- mongoDB as database
