[Skeleton Smash](https://graphics-programming-projects.web.app/final-project/index.html) is a retro first person game developed from scratch using WebGL and Javascript, without a game engine. You can play the game from this [link](https://graphics-programming-projects.web.app/final-project/index.html).

The most brain-wrecking and fun part of this project was writing out custom matrix transformations to simulate a camera in 3D space. Designing and implementing custom shaders in GLSL was also very enjoyable.

This was the final project of the Computer Graphics course at NYU, taught by Ken Perlin Other interesting projects I've done over the course of the semester include: 

- [Shader Art](https://graphics-programming-projects.web.app/hw2/index.html)
- Ray Tracing: [3D Ball Bounce Simulator](https://graphics-programming-projects.web.app/hw4/index.html)
- Procedural Texture: [Blood](https://graphics-programming-projects.web.app/hw8/actual-hw/index.html)
