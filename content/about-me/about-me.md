Hi, I'm Ahmet, a software engineer at Project Pluto, building the [Terminal X](https://terminal-x.ai/), an AI platform helping top investment firms make smarter decisions.

While I specialize in backend engineering, I also do infrastructure, devops, frontend, data engineering, AI systems, and everything in between. 

Essentially doing whatever necessary to solve problems (technical or not), even the ones that might not be obvious, until they're solved.

Besides programming, I like:
- Football (Avid supporter of [Beşiktaş](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F_J.K.))
- Video Games (Favorite games include Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Last Of Us Series) 
- Movies ([Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/iltenahmet/))
- Fitness 
- Coffee
- Thinking
- My friends
