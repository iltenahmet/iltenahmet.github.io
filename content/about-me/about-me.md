Hi, I'm Ahmet, a recent NYU graduate with a computer science degree. I like making and playing games, programming, and football (soccer). On this site, you can find my portfolio, my blog, and some relevant links.

I have recently released my first game on Steam, called [Echoes Of Steel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580010/Echoes_Of_Steel/). 

Currently working at [Moira Labs](https://www.moiralabs.net/), building [The Lost War](http://thelostwar.net/).
