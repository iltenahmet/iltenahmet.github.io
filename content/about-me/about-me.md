Hi, I'm Ahmet, a software engineer who likes tackling hard problems. Currently working at [Moira Labs](https://www.moiralabs.net/), building [The Lost War](http://thelostwar.net/), available in early access on [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-lost-war-ea53eb).

I've released my first solo game a while ago, [Echoes Of Steel](https://ahmetilten.com/portfolio/echoes-of-steel/), available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580010/Echoes_Of_Steel/).

Besides programming, I like:
- Football (Avid supporter of [Beşiktaş](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F_J.K.))
- Video Games (Favorite games include Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Last Of Us Series) 
- Movies ([Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/iltenahmet/))
- Fitness and Crossfit
