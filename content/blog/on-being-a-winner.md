One must always think of oneself as a winner.

<!-- more -->

Unlike most other games, the game of life doesn't come with a clear goal. It is up to the individual to determine the goals, and there are infinitely many goals one could pursue.

Therefore in this game, being a winner or a loser is less about the outcomes of specific goals and more about **being** in a state of of winning, created by one's actions. 

In a previous [post](https://ahmetilten.com/blog/on-progress/), I mentioned that human actions are based on emotions. It's very important that one is in an emotional state that allows for winner-like actions.

Emotions precede action. And belief precedes emotions. 

The most straightforward way to get into such an emotional state is through the **belief** that one is a winner.

The kind of belief that requires no explanation or justification. When something bad happens, the kind that says "Doesn't matter, because I'm a winner.", and when something good happens, the kind that goes "Of course it happened, because I'm a winner.".

This kind of belief opens the doors for a barrage of positive emotions that fill one with optimism, enable one to interpret situations from a constructive viewpoint, and show resilience in tough circumstances. 

In such a state, it's really hard to do loser-like things; it's like swimming against the current.
