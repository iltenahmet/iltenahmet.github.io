Human beings are not rational creatures. Human beings are emotional creatures who are *capable* of reason.

I believe this is the main reason why theoretical knowledge alone is not enough to trigger the right action.

Pain or pleasure, which are different sides of the same coin, are far better teachers than reason. But we must not forget about the second part of the equation: that human beings are capable of reason.

Without applying this capability to reflect on our joy and our sorrow, we risk getting stuck in a regressive loop, not being able to progress.

So first comes the emotion, then comes the reason (in the form of reflection), and then comes progress.
I think most intelligent people have it backwards. They start with the reason (in the form of planning, theorizing), yet their actions don't follow, as actions are based on emotions not reason.

Pain + Reflection = Progress

is the phrase I've seen Ray Dalio use in a recent podcast appearance. This is what I should base my thinking on. Without pain (or pleasure), there is nothing to reflect on, and all the theory is shallow. I might understand it conceptually, but I won't embody it.

Only as a supplement to pain or pleasure, theoretical knowledge *sinks in*.

My natural inclination is to understand a given situation logically first, and then act. But the real progress comes from acting first, failing (most likely) or succeeding, and then understanding the situation on a logical level, through retrospection.

Then, whatever knowledge I gain will *stick*. This is something I should remind myself constantly.
